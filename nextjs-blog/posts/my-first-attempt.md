## Hello, So Here It Is...

I followed a Next.js tutorial to create my own little space on the internet to write a bit about my experiences of learning to code, and to also hopefully capture some snapshots of my development over time.

I have been on a [full time coding bootcamp](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) for the last three months- and prior to this I thought a console log was one of those fancy virtual fireplaces people have in their homes.

I'm now a "graduate", and according to my coaches and peers should now consider myself a **developer**.

To be honest though- I find calling myself a developer a bit strange, and it doesn't feel quite right yet. Maybe it's because what I've learnt the most, from three months of intense studying, breaking things, finding bugs... is just how much more there is to learn.

## The Finished Article

So I could easily imagine that- given the scope of how much you can do with code, with development, and with software- most so called "developers" might feel a bit weird about being labelled as such, because in reality being a dev is about constantly developing. (Right?)

**So with that in mind** I hope this site can start as a learning diary- and you can both see, as well as read, as I go about doing it all again- bending, testing, breaking, and experimenting to develop this into something new. You can probably smell the **anxiety** from wherever you are.

I hope you enjoy reading this- and maybe you might identify with the highs and the lows of trying to figure out how this thing that I have made actually works.

## If You're A Fellow Traveller

If you are also, like me, at the start of a journey of learning how to "code". I thought I might end with some tips (or rather- things that might help you that I didn't do right away until I got stressed and sought advice from wiser people).

## Do

- Just give things a try, and don't expect success right away (I still haven't finished my Rock, Paper, Scissors game)
- Take breaks, the error message will still be there when you get back
- Google it (you can't hold it all in your own head)
- Make a plan (it's really easy to get into the reeds even with the "simpler" things)

## Don't

- Go it alone, look for people to code with
- Assume you're holding someone back by asking questions (most of the good people I worked with were also just trying to figure things out themselves as well and appreciated the chat)
- Lose track of what you're doing/ have done (you can tie yourself up in knots really quickly if you try hail mary syntax)

## And that's it for now

Like I say, this will probably be up and down, fixed and broken...

But once I figure things out a bit more I hope to put lots of pictures, progress, and more posts up soon to (hopefully) help you, and help me learn some more about becoming a developer.
